 The Renaissance and Baroque periods		</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;" font size="5%"> 
 When Catherine de Médicis married King Henry II of France in 1533, she brought from Italy a taste for entertainments in which dancing was prominent.
 Her encouragement established the court ballet (ballet de cour) as the foundation of classical ballet, the source of a new theatrical identity for music and a precursor of French opera.				
   As a unified blend of poetry, music, and movement, 
  the court ballet dates from the performance of the Ballet comique de la reine at a court
  wedding in 1581. The form comprised an optional number of scenes in mime and dance,
   prefaced by explanatory verses that were either spoken or sung; the scenes were accompanied by solo and choral songs with lute, and instrumental ensemble pieces for strings.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;" font size="5%">Baroque music
	is a style of Western art music composed from approximately
  1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance,
  and was followed in turn by the Classical era. The word "baroque" comes from the Portuguese word barroco,
 meaning misshapen pearl, a negative description of the ornate and heavily ornamented music of this period. Later, the name came to apply also to the architecture of the same period.</p>
  
  
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;" font size="5%">
 Baroque music forms a major portion of the "classical music" 
 canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. 
 Composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach,
 George Frideric Handel, Alessandro Scarlatti, Domenico Scarlatti, 
 Antonio Vivaldi, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully,
   Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Denis Gaultier,
  Claudio Monteverdi, Heinrich Schütz, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jan Dismas Zelenka,and Johann Pachelbel.</p>
  
  
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;" font size="5%">
The Baroque period saw the creation of tonality. During the period, 
composers and performers used more elaborate musical ornamentation, 
made changes in musical notation, and developed new instrumental playing
 techniques. Baroque music expanded the size, range, and complexity of 
 instrumental performance, and also established opera, cantata, oratorio,
 concerto, and sonata as musical genres. Many musical terms and concepts
 from this era are still in use today.</p>
